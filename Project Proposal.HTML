                About: My website, Moorprofit.com, is a site to drive awareness, history, and 
                wealth to black businesses in the goal of economically 
                empowering the black community. 
                <br>
                <br>

                Purpose: The purpose is to drive awareness and potentially traffic to black owned businesses through 
                content creation and traffic generation made through blogging on this site. 
                <br>
                <br>

                Target Audience: Moorprofit's target audience is online black consumers that surf the web. Therefore,
                the content of this site will be geared towards driving them to black owned businesses online.

                <br>

                Content: I plan to make blog posts, videos, and images of successful black entrepreneurs, businesses, and 
                economic history throughout the site. These pieces of content will educate, excite, and entertain the black 
                consumer that is surfing the web.
